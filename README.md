#Basic Singleton

This is a singleton design pattern in Swift in it's most basic form. 

Just showing the creation of an array in the Singleton and passing that data through an empty VC print statement in swift.

This will hopefully be part of a series that will involve more iOS design patterns that I'm fortunate enough to pick up and a more complicated Singleton as time goes on.
